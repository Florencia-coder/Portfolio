  "projects.foods.title": "Food's",
  "projects.foods.description": `My first project: a Single Page Application (SPA) that displays food recipes obtained from an external API. It also allows users to add their own recipes, storing them in a database. It features advanced filters by name, diet type, score, and more.`,
  "is.food.responsive": "Yes",

  "projects.vitau.title": "Vitau.mx",
  "projects.vitau.description": `My first work experience as a web developer. I worked on developing and maintaining a mobile application for a Mexican healthcare startup. I implemented new features, optimized performance, and collaborated in an agile team.`,
  "is.vitau.responsive": "No",

  "projects.webNotes.title": "Web Notes",
  "projects.webNotes.description": `I developed this project after noticing that note management was a recurring functionality in technical tests. I found it an interesting challenge, so I built it with a complete approach. It's a SPA that allows CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for notes, archiving them, changing themes, and is fully responsive.`,
  "is.webNotes.responsive": "Yes",

  "projects.kies.title": "KiEs",
  "projects.kies.description": `The KiEs platform was developed together with an excellent friend and colleague, Lucas. It's a web platform for physiotherapy for a client. It allows registering patients with their ID and performing three analyses: ventral (image or live camera), lateral (profile image), and spinous processes. In each analysis, key points can be marked on the body to obtain an estimated result. It also generates a PDF with the analysis performed.`,
  "is.kies.responsive": "Yes",

  "projects.materialFs.title": "FullStack Material",
  "projects.materialFs.description": `My goal with this project is to share my knowledge as a Full Stack developer in the most accessible way possible. I created materials in Notion, compiling information from official documentation, study materials I used when I started, AI tools, and my experience in the field. It not only includes materials and examples, but I've also added sections on "Important Notes," "Best Practices," and more. I plan to continue expanding it with practical exercises to reinforce the learning and make it accessible to more people.`,
  "is.materialFs.responsive": "Yes",

  "projects.ticketazo.title": "Ticketazo",
  "projects.ticketazo.description": `This project was born to solve a common problem in bars: the clutter of order-taking. Ticketazo System allows customers to place orders directly from their table, share them with others, and manage multiple orders at the same table. It's a simple yet effective solution, with a responsive interface for ease of use from any device.`,
  "is.ticketazo.responsive": "Yes",

  "projects.portfolio.title": "Portfolio",
  "projects.portfolio.description": `This project was an idea I'd had in mind for a while, but I couldn't find a style that truly represented me. I tried several versions before, but none of them quite suited me. I feel like this version is the one that comes closest to what I like, and during the design process, I discovered how much more I can explore with CSS and its amazing effects.`,
  "is.portfolio.responsive": "Yes",

  "projects.paint.title": "Paint",

  // Technologies
  "tech.typescript.description": `I truly discovered TypeScript in my first job as a web developer. 
Although I had seen it before, I hadn't taken the time to explore it in depth. 
Today, it's one of my favorite technologies, and its ability to improve code scalability and maintainability is unmatched.`,

  "tech.javascript.description": `JavaScript is the programming language I use in most of my projects since I learned it in early 2020. I have a solid foundation, as I've deepened my understanding of its workings and applied it in logic, data structures, frontend, and backend. Additionally, I've created educational material about it.`,

  "tech.ReactJS.description":
    "I love this library. Its modularity and component-based approach make it easy to create scalable and well-structured applications. I've been using it every day since I discovered it.",

  "tech.reactQuery.description": `I've used React Query to manage state, cache, perform API queries, and manage mutations. It's allowed me to optimize my code and improve application performance. It's a library that has a lot to offer.`,

  "tech.reactNative.description": `I started using this technology during my first job experience. Its similarity to ReactJS facilitated my learning curve. Combining my personal and professional projects, I have approximately two years of experience with this library.`,

  "tech.html5.description": `Thanks to my mastery of JavaScript, HTML has become much more intuitive for me. I've used it extensively, especially in projects with Flask, and have a solid foundation in its structure and semantics.`,

  "tech.css.description": `I prefer to work with pure CSS. While preprocessors like SASS are useful, new CSS features have made it increasingly efficient on its own.`,

  "tech.reactRedux.description": `For global state management, Redux has been my primary library of choice. While I'm familiar with useContext and the Redux Toolkit, I feel most comfortable working with Redux.`,

  "tech.sequelize.description": `Sequelize is the only ORM I've used so far, and I've found it to be extremely useful and intuitive. Its ability to efficiently handle relational databases makes it a great tool. Sequelize is the only ORM I've used so far, and I've found it to be extremely useful and intuitive. Its ability to efficiently handle relational databases makes it a great tool.`,

  "tech.nodeJS.description": `I consider NodeJS my key ally in both the frontend and backend. It's a versatile technology that I've used in various projects.`,

  "tech.PostgreSQL.description": `Relational databases have many similarities, but PostgreSQL was the first one I learned and is the one I'm most familiar with. Although I have experience with others, I still prefer it for its robustness and efficiency.`,

  "tech.express.description": `For server creation, Express, combined with Sequelize, has been an excellent match. I like its simplicity and flexibility.`,

  "tech.python.description": `Python is one of my favorite languages. I studied it in depth for a year at UTN, where I learned the fundamentals of programming and OOP. I love its clear and structured syntax, as well as its strong typing.`,

  "tech.linux.description": `I'm familiar with several Linux distributions, primarily Ubuntu and Mint. My interest in this operating system has facilitated my use of GitBash, the code editor terminal, and various configuration commands.`,

  "tech.jest.description": `I learned and used Jest during my work experience with React. This unit testing tool has been key to validating the functionality of my applications.`,
